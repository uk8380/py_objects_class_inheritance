=>Python is an object oriented programming language.

=>Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

=>A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

=>Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

=>Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
